I spent a few months working with Guru to improve their customer-facing product (and to brush up on my React skills!) Here is a taste of just some of the things I did:

## A better on-boarding experience

I added useful information and brand personality to many "inbox-zero" pages that were previously blank. For new users, this helps with on-board by explaining what each section of the site is used for, and for existing users, this gives them something nice to look at!

> <row markdown="block">
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru blank questions]({{ page.assets }}guru-blank-questions.png)
> </column>
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru blank mentions]({{ page.assets }}guru-blank-mentions.png)
> </column>
> </row>




## Accessibility improvements

I created an internal guide on creating React components with accessibility best practices in mind, highlighting the importance of semantic code and keyboard navigability. As an example, I implemented a checkbox as Guru's first fully accessible component, with (hopefully) many more to come!

Here are screenshots of keyboard navigability in action thanks to focus states:

> <row markdown="block">
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru checkbox 1]({{ page.assets }}guru-checkbox-1.png)
> </column>
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru checkbox 2]({{ page.assets }}guru-checkbox-2.png)
> </column>
> </row>

Additionally, I worked on other various improvement for users with Reduce Motion and Increase Contrast enabled in their accessibility settings.

## Profile pictures

I worked on improving profile pictures across the site with a new default avatar system based on user initials.

> <row markdown="block">
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru avatar users]({{ page.assets }}guru-avatar-users.png)
> </column>
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru avatars feed]({{ page.assets }}guru-avatars-feed.png)
> </column>
> </row>

I also revamped how avatars are uploaded on the site. Here are some before and after screenshots:

> <row markdown="block">
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru upload before]({{ page.assets }}guru-upload-before.png)
> </column>
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru upload after]({{ page.assets }}guru-upload-after.png)
> </column>
> </row>

> <row markdown="block">
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru preview before]({{ page.assets }}guru-preview-before.png)
> </column>
> <column markdown="block" width="50">
> ![guru preview after]({{ page.assets }}guru-preview-after.png)
> </column>
> </row>

## A ton of other tiny things

 I also worked on other various internal tools and improving development workflow, including, but not limited to:

- Getting React Developer Tools to work _inside_ Chrome'e extension sandbox!
- Fixing an issue with `git-flow-avh`!
- Debugging Electron apps!
- A new content sharing workflow!
- And more!
