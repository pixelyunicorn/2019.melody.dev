<p class="lead">
  With 306.9 million annual trips, the <strong>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA)</strong> has a heavily-utilized System Status page that displays critical information for riders, such as real time vehicle locations, detours, delays, and suspensions. I managed the project and work alonside the development team at <strong>PennApps Fellows</strong> to redesign and rewrite that page for the mobile era.

## Easy to Navigate

One of the main concerns from the client was that they wanted keep the main page familiar to existing users. That allowed us to implement a cleaner layout that makes an extensive list of routes easier to navigate.

> ### Main Page
>
> <row>
>		<column class="no-margin-bottom"><i>Before</i><img src="{{ page.assets }}septa-home-before.png" alt="Before my rewrite"></column>
>		<column class="no-margin-bottom"><i>After</i><img src="{{ page.assets }}septa-home-after.png" alt="After my rewrite"></column>
>	</row>

When an individual route is selected, critical information Alerts, Detours, Advisories, Elevator Outages, and a Live Map are displayed on the screen. The existing page had a confusing modal containing an accordion that only displayed one section at a time.

I redesigned this part of the project by creating a single page application (in React) that lists everything on a single screen. As an added bonus, hash navigation allows a user to bookmark a specific route for future reference.

> ### Route Display
>
> <row>
>		<column class="no-margin-bottom"><i>Before: Modal Accordion</i><img src="{{ page.assets }}septa-route-before.png" alt="Before my rewrite"></column>
>		<column class="no-margin-bottom"><i>After: Single Page</i><img src="{{ page.assets }}septa-route-after.png" alt="After my rewrite"></column>
>	</row>

## Mobile-First Design

The most common use case for the System Status page is for mobile users to track their vehicles in realtime, yet the current website is nowhere close to being optimized for the most common mobile devices on the market. Using responsive design, we developed the page to be mobile friendly with easy-to-find routes and automatic location detection (after location permission is granted.)

> ### Mobile User Flow
> <row>
>		<column class="no-margin-bottom"><i>Mode Selection</i><img src="{{ page.assets }}septa-mobile-1.png" alt="Before my rewrite"></column>
>		<column class="no-margin-bottom"><i>Route Selection</i><img src="{{ page.assets }}septa-mobile-2.png" alt="After my rewrite"></column>
>		<column class="no-margin-bottom"><i>Route Status Display</i><img src="{{ page.assets }}septa-mobile-3.png" alt="After my rewrite"></column>
>	</row>

## Bad Data? No Problem!

Once of the most interesting challenges with this project was working on an [API (data feed)](https://sidewaysdictionary.com/#/term/api) that did not provide data in a developer-friendly format. This API was full of inconsistencies (and typos!) but it was the best form of information that SEPTA had to offer. Thankfully, React makes it easy to iron out these inconsistencies, so strings like `Yes` and `Y` were turned into booleans like `true` as data flows in. [(Don’t believe us?
